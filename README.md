# Python TurtleFun
Its an edited version of my fav first self made program well i just applied the concept of loops along with turtle module
for that you need to enter following values for angle and last limit: 90(default is degree) and end limit could be changed but 
I use 100 because it repeats the same and it would be meaningless if you input a big value say 10000. well you can also add attribute 
to the steps to have some difference between parallel line or 5th line in the case of angle 90.

How to execute?
Just extract the zip file(code) and open TurtleFun.exe
Enter values and enjoy.
